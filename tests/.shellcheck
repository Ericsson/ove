     21  SC2059: Don't use variables in the printf format string. Use printf "..%s.." "$foo".
      7  SC2031: all_files was modified in a subshell. That change might be lost.
      5  SC2206: Quote to prevent word splitting/globbing, or split robustly with mapfile or read -a.
      3  SC2207: Prefer mapfile or read -a to split command output (or quote to avoid splitting).

      2  SC2030: Modification of all_files is local (to subshell caused by pipeline).
      2  SC2004: $/${} is unnecessary on arithmetic variables.
      1  SC2129: Consider using { cmd1; cmd2; } >> file instead of individual redirects.
      1  SC2034: foo appears unused. Verify use (or export if used externally).
      1  SC2034: bar appears unused. Verify use (or export if used externally).
